# Graph Neural Network for finding the shortest path

This repository houses the code for "Graph Neural Network for finding the shortest path" and is consisted of 3 parts
1) Implementation of A* algorithm
2) Collection of shortest paths
3) Train & Test a Graph Neural Network that given an initial and goal node, outputs the shortest path

Installation of dependencies:
* First, run pip install -r requirements.txt
* Next, 


To run, simply execute python3 main.py. This will, by default, start training the graph neural network with the graph dataset which the labels is obtained from the A* algorithm.
